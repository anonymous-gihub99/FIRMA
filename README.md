Official implementation of **"FIRMA: Bidirectional Formal-Informal Mathematical Language Alignment with Proof-Theoretic Grounding"** accepted at [MathNLP 2025 Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/mathnlp2025) at EMNLP 2025.

## 📢 Paper Highlights

FIRMA (Formal-Informal Reasoning in Mathematical Alignment) is the first bidirectional translation system between formal and informal mathematical language that leverages proof-theoretic interpretability hierarchies to guarantee proof preservation while maintaining pedagogical clarity.

### Key Contributions:
- 🔄 **Bidirectional Translation**: Seamlessly translate between formal mathematical proofs (Lean 4) and natural language explanations
- 📊 **Hierarchical Architecture**: Novel complexity-aware routing with proof-preserving attention mechanisms
- 🎯 **Multi-Objective Training**: Balances formal correctness, round-trip consistency, and natural readability
- 📈 **Progressive Complexity Training**: Curriculum learning from basic arithmetic to advanced proofs
- 🔬 **Proof-Theoretic Grounding**: First to connect proof-theoretic hierarchies to translation quality

### Performance Highlights:
- ✅ **84.3% proof-checking success rate** (vs 67.2% for GPT-4)
- 📖 **10% improvement** in human readability scores
- ⚡ **2x faster** inference than comparable models
- 🎓 Successfully handles **4 complexity levels** of mathematical reasoning

> **📌 Note**: We are actively working on extended results and additional experiments. Please check our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/anonymous-gihub99/FIRMA) regularly for updates, including:
> - Expanded evaluation on larger test sets
> - Additional baseline comparisons
> - Human evaluation studies (N=50+)
> - Cross-domain generalization experiments
> - Interactive demo notebook

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/anonymous-gihub99/FIRMA.git
cd FIRMA

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download pretrained model (optional)
wget https://huggingface.co/firma/firma-qwen-7b/resolve/main/firma_model.tar.gz
tar -xzf firma_model.tar.gz -C ./firma_model_t4/final/
```

### Quick Inference

```python
from firma_model_t4 import FIRMA, FIRMAConfig
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

# Initialize model
config = FIRMAConfig()
model = FIRMA(config)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B", trust_remote_code=True)

# Formal to Informal translation
formal_stmt = "∀x ∈ ℝ : x + 0 = x"
prompt = f"Translate to informal: {formal_stmt}\nInformal:"
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
output = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=128)
print(tokenizer.decode(output[0]))
# Output: "For any real number x, adding zero to x gives x"

# Informal to Formal translation
informal_stmt = "The derivative of x squared is 2x"
prompt = f"Translate to formal: {informal_stmt}\nFormal:"
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
output = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=128)
print(tokenizer.decode(output[0]))
# Output: "d/dx(x²) = 2x"
```

### Training from Scratch

```bash
# Single GPU
python train_firma.py

# Multi-GPU (4x T4 GPUs)
torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 firma_model_t4.py

# Evaluate
python evaluate_firma_real.py

# Generate paper visualizations
python visualize_results.py
```

## 🔬 Model Architecture

FIRMA employs a hierarchical encoder-decoder architecture with:
- **Hierarchical Encoder**: Multi-level abstraction for mathematical reasoning
- **Complexity Router**: Learned gating mechanism for specialized pathways
- **Proof-Preserving Attention**: Modified attention to respect logical flow
- **Multi-Objective Loss**: Balances translation, round-trip consistency, complexity, and validity
